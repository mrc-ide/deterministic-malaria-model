\usage{
vivax_equilibrium_init_create(
  age_vector,
  het_brackets,
  country = NULL,
  admin_unit = NULL,
  ft,
  EIR,
  K_max,
  model_param_list
)
}
\arguments{
\item{age_vector}{Vector of age brackets.}

\item{het_brackets}{Integer number of biting heteogenity compartments.}

\item{country}{String for country of interest. If NULL the seasonal parameters
will attempt to be loaded using just the admin unit, however if there is ambiguity
in the admin unit an error will be thrown. If both NULL then no seasonality is
assumed. Default = NULL.}

\item{admin_unit}{String for admin unit with country for loading seasonal
parameters. If country is NULL, the admin unit will attempt to be located,however
if there is ambiguity in the admin unit an error will be thrown. If both country
and admin_unit are NULL then no seasonality is assumed. Default = NULL.}

\item{ft}{Numeric for the frequency of people seeking treatment.}

\item{EIR}{Numeric for desired annual EIR.}

\item{K_max}{Maximum number of hypnozoite batches. Has to be an integer between
1 and 30. Note a model with stratification into larger number of hypnozoite batches
(e.g. K_max > 5) may have to be run on the cluster. For an EIR of 1 or less,
K_max = 2 is sufficient.}

\item{model_param_list}{List of epidemiological parameters created by}
}
\description{
The function \code{vivax_equilibrium_init_create} creates an equilibrium initialisation state to be
used within later model runs
